            <h5>Software Developer</h5>
            <h5>Academic Tutor @ University of Adelaide</h5>
            <p>As a highly motivated and dedicated professional with strong communication and interpersonal skills, I graduated from the University of Adelaide at the end of 2018. </p>
            <p>After completed the two-years master program of Computing and Innovation, I got a GPA 6.44/7 and an average score of 85/100, which indicates a solid programming skill and a deep understanding of software development.</p>
            <p>Before studying in the University of Adelaide, I was a Development Engineer with five years' working experience. I have been extensively involved in new medical device product and technology development processes, which have allowed me to develop strong project execution and innovation skills, as well as the abilities to work closely with my peers.</p>
            <p>These experiences have allowed me to develop strong time management and organizational skills, which I see as being very important when seeking to work while continuing to study.</p>
