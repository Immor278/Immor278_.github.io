            <p><b>Winner of the 2018 Software Engineering Prize, the University Adelaide</b></p>
            <p>We developed a rescue robot using Lego MindStorm EV3 kit. This robot could detect and identify the survivor, obstacle, and boundary in the rescue scenario. The robot is able to search a two-story building to locate all survivors.</p>
